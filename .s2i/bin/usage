This is the rshiny-centos7 S2I image. 
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Sample invocation (note the use of incremental so the second time you build packrat deps should not need to be downloaded):

s2i build https://github.com/DFEAGILEDEVOPS/schools-workforce-benchmarking.git rshiny-centos7 sample-app --incremental

Note if you have changed your dependencies you may have to build without the incremental flag to force updates. 

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 3838:3838 sample-app
